# HumanTyper Pro - Realistic Content Simulator

HumanTyper Pro is a tool that simulates realistic human typing.  
It features variable typing speeds, natural pauses, and customizable typing errors (typos).  
This helps make generated content look like it was written by a real human instead of being AI-generated.
